            <p>From fighter pilot to introducing a new breed of horse to the UK, the life of Maureen Dunlop de Popp is an eye-opening account.</p>
            <p>Born Maureen Adele Chase Dunlop on October 26, 1920, in the town of Quilmes near Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires,
                she was the daughter of Australian citizen and farmer Eric Chase Dunlop and Jessimin May Williams, an English woman.
                Mr Dunlop had fought as a volunteer for the Royal Field Artillery during the First World War.
            </p>
            <p>During the holidays, she and her siblings - Joan and Eric – regularly visited England.
                In the summer of 1936, she took her first flying lesson, and on returning to Buenos Aires,
                she backdated her birth certificate to continue accumulating flight time at the Aero Club Argentino.
            </p>
            <p>When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she joined more than 4,500 volunteers, including hundreds of women,
                and decided to fight against the Nazis. Although she always kept her Argentine citizenship, the UK became her second home.
            </p>
            <p>By 1942, she had accumulated 500 hours of flight time and with that background went to London where the Air Chief Marshall Trafford Leigh-Mallory
                said women should not be allowed to become fighter pilots. Instead, she joined the British civilian organisation Air Traffic Auxiliary (ATA)
                as a female pilot and was nicknamed Attagirl alongside other female pilots.
            </p>
            <p>Before the end of the war, she had flown more than 800 hours piloting the principal combat aircrafts both De Havilland Mosquito,
                Supermarine Spitfire, North American Mustang, Hawker Typhoon, Tempests, and Bristol Blenheim, as well as Vickers Wellington bombers,
                in addition to other less famous planes, adding up to a total of 38 single and multi-engine aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>She once said: “I longed for flying in combat. I thought that it was the only fair thing. Why should the enemies only be killed by men?”</p>
            <p>Returning to Argentina, where she stayed until 1969, she flew aircraft in the Argentine Air Force working as a flight instructor.
                She never received the badge for military pilot’s wings. During this time, she also instructed Aerolíneas Argentina’s pilots
                and worked as a commercial pilot for an air taxi company where she was a partner.
            </p>
            <p>In 1955, she married Serbian diplomat, Victor Popp. The couple had a son and two daughters who were raised on their stud farm, Milla Lauquen Stud.
                Then in 1973, the family moved to England and settled in Norfolk on another stud farm breeding pure-blood Arab horses.
                She had been a pioneer who introduced the creole horse in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>After almost four decades in Norfolk, she died in Norwich on May 29, 2012.</p>
